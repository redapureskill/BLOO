Hi My name's YAHLA MOHAMMED REDA,
The developer of this application .

This application is an idea came up to my head while we're in these 
lock down moments of corona virus.

So basically what you can do with it is : 

1) create a patient [patient state = "Healthy" ]
2) Initialize the patient's symptoms.
3) run diagnosis.
4) confirm diagnosis/ diseases
5) Compute treatment
6) Check patient Medical history [history of actions 
	made on disease list(add/delete)

Extra cases : 
7)You can add/ delete immediatly the disease from the patient disease list
8)Patient states is : 
	['Healthy' -> by default]
	['Sick' -> if diseases list not empty]
	['Recovered' -> if diseases list is empty]
	['Possible sick' -> if the Patient's symptoms match more than
	50% of a disease's symptoms]

When you install the module, you will have 2 patients initialized with their
symptoms as example.
i suggest you to confirm diseases, compute the symptoms, then try playing with
the disease list like you are doctors :), at the same time watch the patient state
and the medical history of the patient.


I wish you enjoyed the test, and please even if i wont get selected let me know what 
errors did i make, so i can improve my self.

Advanced thanks.

Best Regards.
